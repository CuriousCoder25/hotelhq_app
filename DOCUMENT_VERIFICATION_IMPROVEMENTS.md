## Next Steps

1. Test the application by starting it and accessing the staff dashboard
2. Upload some test documents as a customer
3. Verify the document verification workflow as staff
4. Check that all actions provide proper feedback
5. Ensure database updates are working correctly

The document verification system is now much more robust, user-friendly, and provides comprehensive feedback for all operations!
