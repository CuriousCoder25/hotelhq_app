3. **Enhanced API Endpoints** (app.py)

## Why You Might Not See the Features:

### Most Likely Reason: **No Pending Documents**
The enhanced verification queue only shows when there are customers with pending document status. If all customers have "Approved" status or no customers exist, you'll see the "All documents verified!" message instead.

## How to See the Enhanced Features:

### Option 1: Open the Test Page
```
Open: c:\Users\gaura\Desktop\hotelhq_app\test_enhanced_features.html
```
This shows exactly what the enhanced features look like.

### Option 2: Create Test Customers with Pending Documents

1. **Start the application:**
   ```cmd
   cd c:\Users\gaura\Desktop\hotelhq_app
   start_hotel_app.bat
   ```

2. **Login as Admin/Staff** and go to Staff Dashboard

3. **Add a new customer** (using "Add New Customer" button)

4. **The new customer will automatically have 'Pending' document status**

5. **You'll now see the enhanced verification queue with:**
   - Better styling and colors
   - 4 action buttons (View, Approve, Reject, Reset to Pending)
   - Enhanced layout with customer contact info
   - Status badges with proper colors

### Option 3: Check Database Manually
```sql
UPDATE customer SET document_status = 'Pending' WHERE User_ID IN (1, 2, 3);
```
This will create pending documents for existing customers.

## What the Enhanced Features Look Like:

### Enhanced Queue Table:
- **Better headers:** Customer | Contact | Status | Actions
